1. What findings were detected related to the brute force attack?
UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce

i-085sc4c6c4037f82e is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.112.
Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password

3. Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information?

Attacks can occur because a rule with Type SSH allows connections from all sources (0.0.0.0/0) over Port Range 22. Allowing 0.0.0.0/0 over Port Range 22 introduces a security risk.

From documentation:

"Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs"

Typically these attacks come from bots that are looking for targets to intrude EC2 instances. You can mitigate the risk of intrusion by restricting SSH access. It's a best practice to configure security groups to allow SSH access only from specific sources that you own, such as from bastion host.

VPC Flow should show the attack attemtps.

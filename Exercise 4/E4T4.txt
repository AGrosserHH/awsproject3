1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Remove ssh access

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
It would not prevent the unauthorized access. It will limit the communication between the VCP network

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, only new objects are encrypted.

4.The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
Will get back to the original estate.
